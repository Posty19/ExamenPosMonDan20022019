                Welcome back, Agent. The world needs you now more than ever.” – Charles Goodwin, Agency Director. Crackdown 3 features a brand new story Campaign that you can play alone or with a friend in two-player co-op over Xbox Live. Explore the dangerous streets and treacherous heights of the island metropolis, “New Providence”. Use your powerful Agent Skills and an arsenal of weapons and equipment to bring the leaders of the cruel and corrupt “TerraNova” corporation to justice. As the game begins, the whole world is in peril. “Blackout” attacks have thrown cities into chaos. Millions of refugees are on the move. And at the heart of the mystery… is a strange element known only as “Chimera”. Now it’s up to the Agency to liberate New Providence and stop the Blackout before the whole world plunges into darkness. Time to step it up, Agent! Along with the franchise favorite Agency Director, Crackdown 3 features an all-new cast of characters. These ruthless bosses of TerraNova will protect their divisions with everything they’ve got. When you hit them, they’ll punch back even harder, unleashing retaliatory attacks that can strike anywhere in New Providence. Destroy TerraNova assets to weaken the enemy bosses, assault their soaring towers, and terminate their employment.
